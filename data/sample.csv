,What is slicing in Python?,"Slicing is used to access parts of sequences like lists, tuples, and strings. The syntax of slicing is-[start:end:step]. The step can be omitted as well. When we write [start:end] this returns all the elements of the sequence from the start (inclusive) till the end-1 element. If the start or end element is negative i, it means the ith element from the end. The step indicates the jump or how many elements have to be skipped. Eg. if there is a list- [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. Then [-1:2:2] will return elements starting from the last element till the third element by printing every second element.i.e. [8,6,4].",,,,,

They both provide a way to generate a list of integers for you to use, however you please. The only difference is that range returns a Python list object and x range returns an xrange object. This means that xrange doesn’t actually generate a static list at run-time like range does. It creates the values as you need them with a special technique called yielding. This technique is used with a type of object known as generators. That means that if you have a really gigantic range you’d like to generate a list for, say one billion, xrange is the function to use. This is especially true if you have a really memory sensitive system such as a cell phone that you are working with, as range will use as much memory as it can to create your array of integers, which can result in a Memory Error and crash your program.

https://infoshareacademy.com/blog/2019/11/06/wielki-test-wiedzy-o-pythonie-cz-i/,"Która z poniższych komend przypisze do zmiennej result ciąg znaków ""Python""?","W Pythonie jednym ze sposobów na konkatenację stringów (inaczej łączenie ciągów znaków) jest wykorzystanie operatora +. Jest to możliwe, gdyż typ wbudowany str implementuje odpowiednie metody umożliwiając realizację operacji takich jak konkatenacja czy indeksowanie, za pomocą operatorów działających też na typach sekwencyjnych. Zapis tego typu jest bardzo czytelny, więc aby połączyć nowy ciąg znaków z istniejącą już wartością, zapisaną w zmiennej można skorzystać z operatora +=.Korzystając z + do konkatenacji stringów należy pamiętać o pewnych ograniczeniach, narzucanych przez charakterystykę tego typu. Typ str jest w Pythonie typem immutable. (zobacz: “Który z typów jest mutable?”). W kontekście operatora + czy też += powoduje to, że każde jego użycie utworzy nowy obiekt str. W większości typowych sytuacji nie będzie to problemem i zastosowanie operatora + będzie dobrym rozwiązaniem ze względu na jego wysoką czytelność. Jednak w sytuacji gdy łączymy ze sobą bardzo dużo ciągów znaków może to mieć negatywne konsekwencje wydajnościowe. W takim przypadku lepiej użyć metody join().

That's just a small sample of the problems we could face. So, how do we deal with such a situation? If our application is running in production mode and an exception occurs, Flask will show us a very plain page and log the exception to the logger by default.",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,Describe Flask Error Handlers.,"In the Flask application, when an error occurs, an HTTP status code will be returned. If the HTTP status code is between 400-499, that means the error occurs on the client-side data request. On the other hand, if the HTTP status code is between 500-599, then it means the error occurs on the server-side application.

When an error occurs with an HTTP status code, we can show custom error pages to the user with the help of error handlers. It can return responses when a certain type of error is occurred, which is similar to a function view that returns a response when the request URL is similar. It passes the object to handle the error, in most cases, it is an HTTPException.

Another thing to note is that the response's HTTP status code is not set to the error handler's code. When returning a response from the error handler, we must make sure to include that.",,,,,

https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,How to upload files in the Flask application?,"Flask makes it simple to manage uploaded files. Just remember to include the enctype=""multipart/form-data"" tag in your HTML form, or the browser will refuse to send your files. Uploaded files are kept in memory or on the filesystem in a temporary place. You may get to those files by looking at the request object's files attribute. Each file that is uploaded is saved in that dictionary. It has the same behavior as a typical Python file object, but it additionally provides a save() method that allows you to save the file to the server's filesystem. Here's a simple example to demonstrate how it works:
from flask import request[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]@app.route('/upload', methods=['GET', 'POST'])[Text Wrapping Break]def upload_file():[Text Wrapping Break]    if request.method == 'POST':[Text Wrapping Break]        f = request.files['the_file'][Text Wrapping Break]        f.save('/var/www/uploads/uploaded_file.txt')

The filename attribute can be used to determine how the file was named on the client before it was uploaded to your application. However, keep in mind that its value might be faked, so don't put your faith in it. If you wish to utilize the client's filename to store the file on the server, you can use the secure filename() function that Werkzeug provides:
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]@app.route('/upload', methods=['GET', 'POST'])[Text Wrapping Break]def upload_file():[Text Wrapping Break]    if request.method == 'POST':[Text Wrapping Break]        file = request.files['the_file'][Text Wrapping Break]        file.save(f""/var/www/uploads/{secure_filename(file.filename)}"")",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,Explain Logging in Flask.,"You can find yourself in a position where you're dealing with data that should be correct but isn't. For example, you might have some client-side code that sends a faulty HTTP request to the server. This could be due to tampering with the data by a user or a bug in the client code. In most cases, responding with 400 Bad Request is sufficient, but this isn't always the case, and the code must continue to function.

You might still wish to note that something unusual occurred. Loggers come in handy in this situation. With Flask 0.3, you can utilize a logger that has been preconfigured for you.

The following are some examples of log calls:
app.logger.debug('A value for debugging')[Text Wrapping Break]app.logger.warning('A warning occurred (%d apples)', 42)[Text Wrapping Break]app.logger.error('An error occurred')",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,What is HTML Escaping in Flask?,"To protect against injection attacks, any user-provided values rendered in the output must be enclosed when returning HTML (the default response type in Flask). This will be done automatically using HTML templates produced with Jinja.

The escape() function, which is seen below, can be used manually. Most examples remove it for brevity's sake, but you should constantly be conscious of how you're employing untrustworthy data.

from markupsafe import escape[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]@app.route(""/<name>"")[Text Wrapping Break]def hello(name):[Text Wrapping Break]    return f""Hello, {escape(name)}!""

If a user enters the name <script>alert(""bad"")</script>, it is rendered as text rather than running the script in the user's browser due to escaping.",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,Explain the url_for() function and why would you want to hard-code URLs into your templates instead of utilizing the URL reversing function url_for()?,"We use the url_for() function to create a URL for a given function. It takes the function's name as the first parameter, as well as any number of keyword arguments, each of which corresponds to a variable component of the URL rule. As query parameters, unknown variable bits are appended to the URL.

    When compared to hard-coding URLs, reversing is typically more descriptive.
    Instead of remembering to manually change hard-coded URLs, you can modify all of your URLs at once.
    The escaping of special characters is handled transparently during URL creation.
    The routes generated are always absolute, avoiding unexpected behavior in browsers due to relative paths.
    If your application is in a directory other than the URL root, such as /myapplication instead of /, url_for() will take care of it",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,Describe the difference between Blueprints and Views in the Flask application?,"Blueprints: A Blueprint is a method of organizing a collection of related views and other code. Instead of registering views and other code with an application directly, they are registered with a blueprint. When the blueprint is available in the factory function, it is then registered with the application. Flask will have two blueprints, one for authentication and the other for blog postings. Each blueprint's code will be kept in its own module.

Views: The code you write to reply to queries to your application is known as a view function. Flask matches the incoming request URL to the view that should handle it using patterns. Flask converts the data returned by the view into an outgoing response. Flask may also generate a URL for a view depending on its name and arguments in the other direction.",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,How to control Autoescaping in Flask?,"Autoescaping is the concept of having special characters automatically escape for you. &, >, <, "", and ' are special characters in the context of HTML (or XML, and thus XHTML). If you want to use these characters in the text, you must replace them with so-called ""entities"" because they have special meanings in documents on their own. Not doing so would not only frustrate users by preventing them from using certain characters in the text, but it might also lead to security issues. (For further information, see Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)).

However, you may need to disable autoescaping in templates on occasion. This is true if you want to inject HTML into sites explicitly, such as when they come from a system that generates secure HTML, such as a markdown to HTML converter.

There are three options for doing so:

    Wrap the HTML string in a Markup object before sending it to the template in Python code. This is the method that is generally suggested.
    To mark a string as safe HTML ({{ myvariable|safe }}), use the |safe filter inside the template.
    Turn off the autoescape system for the time being.

You can use the {% autoescape %} block to disable the autoescape system in templates:[Text Wrapping Break]

{% autoescape false %}[Text Wrapping Break]    <p>autoescaping is disabled here[Text Wrapping Break]    <p>{{ will_not_be_escaped }}[Text Wrapping Break]{% endautoescape %}

Please be very careful about the variables you use in this block whenever you do this.",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,What is Signals in Flask and how to create a Signal?,"Signals allow you to decouple apps by sending notifications when activities in the core framework or other Flask extensions occur. In a nutshell, signals allow particular senders to alert subscribers to an event.

Flask comes with a few signals, and other extensions may add more. Keep in mind that signals are meant to alert subscribers and should not be used to urge them to change their data. You'll notice that several signals appear to accomplish the same thing as some of the built-in decorators (for example, request started looks a lot like before request()). There are, however, variances in how they operate. The before request() handler, for example, is called in a certain order and can cancel a request by returning a response early. All signal handlers, on the other hand, run in an indeterminate order and do not affect any data.

Signals have a significant advantage over handlers in that you can safely subscribe to them for a fraction of a second. These temporary subscriptions are useful for things like unit testing. If you want to know which templates were rendered as part of a request, you can use signals to accomplish so.

Creating Signals: You can use the blinker library directly if you wish to use signals in your own application. Named signals in a custom Namespace are the most prevalent use case. Most of the time, this is what is suggested:

from blinker import Namespace[Text Wrapping Break]my_signals = Namespace()

You can now generate new signals such as this:

model_saved = my_signals.signal('model-saved')

The signal's name makes it stand out and makes debugging easier. The name attribute gives you access to the signal's name.",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,How to decorate Views in Flask application?,"It makes little sense to decorate the view class itself because it is not the view function that is introduced to the routing system. Instead, you'll have to hand-decorate the as_view() return value:
def user_required(f):[Text Wrapping Break]    """"""Checks whether user is logged in or raises error 401.""""""[Text Wrapping Break]    def decorator(*args, **kwargs):[Text Wrapping Break]        if not g.user:[Text Wrapping Break]            abort(401)[Text Wrapping Break]        return f(*args, **kwargs)[Text Wrapping Break]    return decorator[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]view = user_required(UserAPI.as_view('users'))[Text Wrapping Break]app.add_url_rule('/users/', view_func=view)

Starting with Flask 0.8, you can also specify a list of decorators to use in the class declaration:
class UserAPI(MethodView):[Text Wrapping Break]    decorators = [user_required]

Keep in mind that you can't use conventional view decorators on the individual methods of the view because of the implicit self from the caller's perspective.",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,Explain Application Context.,"During a request, CLI command, or other activity, the application context keeps track of application-level data. The current app and g proxies are used instead of passing the application around to each function.

This is similar to The Request Context. The Request Context, which keeps track of request-level data during a request, is comparable to this. When a request context is pushed, it is accompanied by an application context.

Purpose of Application Context: Aspects of the Flask application object, such as config, can be accessed via views and CLI commands. Importing the app instance into your project's modules, on the other hand, is prone to circular import difficulties. There will be no app instance to import when using the app factory pattern or developing reusable blueprints or extensions.

The application context in Flask overcomes this problem. Instead of referring to an app directly, you use the current_app proxy, which points to the application that is now handling the action.

When handling a request, Flask automatically pushes an application context. current_app will be accessible to view functions, error handlers, and other functions that run during a request.

Application Context Lifetime: As needed, the application context is generated and removed. A Flask application pushes an application context and a request context when it starts handling a request. When the request is completed, the request context is displayed, followed by the application context. An application context usually lasts the same amount of time as a request.",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,What are Blueprints and why do we use them? Create a Blueprint in Flask.,"For creating application components and enabling common patterns within and between applications, Flask employs the concept of blueprints. Blueprints can help huge applications run more smoothly by providing a central location for Flask extensions to register activities on them. A Blueprint object is comparable to a Flask application object in functionality, but it is not one. It's more of a template on how to build or enhance an application.

Blueprints in Flask are designed for the following scenarios:

    A set of blueprints can be used to factor an application. This is suitable for larger applications; a project may create an application object, register a collection of blueprints, and initialize many extensions.
    Register a blueprint with a URL prefix and/or subdomain on an application. All view functions in the blueprint use parameters from the URL prefix/subdomain as common view arguments (with defaults).
    Register a blueprint on an application numerous times with different URL rules each time.
    By using blueprints, you can provide template filters, static files, templates, and other tools. It is not necessary for a blueprint to implement applications or view functions.
    When initializing a Flask extension, register a blueprint on an application for any of these scenarios.

This is an example of a very basic blueprint. In this scenario, we'd like to create a blueprint that renders static templates simply:

from flask import Blueprint, render_template, abort[Text Wrapping Break]from jinja2 import TemplateNotFound[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]simple_page = Blueprint('simple_page', __name__,[Text Wrapping Break]                        template_folder='templates')[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]@simple_page.route('/', defaults={'page': 'index'})[Text Wrapping Break]@simple_page.route('/<page>')[Text Wrapping Break]def show(page):[Text Wrapping Break]    try:[Text Wrapping Break]        return render_template(f'pages/{page}.html')[Text Wrapping Break]    except TemplateNotFound:[Text Wrapping Break]        abort(404)

When you use the @simple_page.route decorator to bind a function, the blueprint records your intent to have the function show up on the app when it's later registered. In addition, the endpoint of the method will be prefixed with the name of the blueprint that was sent to the Blueprint constructor (in this case, simple_page). The name of the blueprint does not change the URL, simply the endpoint.",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,Explain Application Factories in terms of Blueprints in the Flask application.,"There are a few of really good ways to improve the experience if you're already utilizing packages and blueprints for your application (Modular Applications with Blueprints). When the blueprint is imported, a common pattern is to create the application object. You can make additional copies of this app later if you move the creation of this object into a function.

So, why would you want to do something like this?

    Testing: To test each example, you can create many instances of the program with varied configurations.
    There are multiple occurrences: Consider the scenario when you wish to run many versions of the same program. Of course, you could set up numerous instances in your web server with various configurations, but if you utilize factories, you can have multiple instances of the same application running in the same application process, which is useful.

So, how would you go about putting that into practice? Well, the idea is to set up the application in a function which we call Application Factories

def create_app(config_filename):[Text Wrapping Break]    app = Flask(__name__)[Text Wrapping Break]    app.config.from_pyfile(config_filename)[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]    from yourapplication.model import db[Text Wrapping Break]    db.init_app(app)[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]    from yourapplication.views.admin import admin[Text Wrapping Break]    from yourapplication.views.frontend import frontend[Text Wrapping Break]    app.register_blueprint(admin)[Text Wrapping Break]    app.register_blueprint(frontend)[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]    return app

The disadvantage is that you can't use the application object in blueprints when they're being imported. However, you can utilize it within a request. With the config, how do you gain access to the application? Make use of current_app:\

from flask import current_app, Blueprint, render_template[Text Wrapping Break]admin = Blueprint('admin', __name__, url_prefix='/admin')[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]@admin.route('/')[Text Wrapping Break]def index():[Text Wrapping Break]    return render_template(current_app.config['INDEX_TEMPLATE'])",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,What is Application Dispatching? Show an example of application dispatching with any WSGI server.,"On the WSGI level, application dispatching is the process of joining numerous Flask apps. You can mix and match any WSGI application, not only Flask. If you like, you can run a Django and a Flask application in the same interpreter at the same time. This is only useful if you know how the programs function within.

The main distinction between this and Large Applications as Packages is that you're running the same or different Flask applications that are completely separate from one another. They are dispatched on the WSGI level and run distinct configurations.

Each technique and example below produces an application object that may be run on any WSGI server. See Deployment Options for production options. Werkzeug provides a server for development via werkzeug.serving.run_simple():

from werkzeug.serving import run_simple[Text Wrapping Break]run_simple('localhost', 5000, application, use_reloader=True)

It's worth noting that run simply isn't meant to be used in production. Make use of a production-ready WSGI server. See Deployment Options for more information.

Debugging must be enabled on both the application and the simple server in order to use the interactive debugger. The ""hello world"" example with debugging and run_simple is as follows:

from flask import Flask[Text Wrapping Break]from werkzeug.serving import run_simple[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]app = Flask(__name__)[Text Wrapping Break]app.debug = True[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]@app.route('/')[Text Wrapping Break]def hello_world():[Text Wrapping Break]    return 'Hello World!'[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]if __name__ == '__main__':[Text Wrapping Break]    run_simple('localhost', 5000, app,[Text Wrapping Break]               use_reloader=True, use_debugger=True, use_evalex=True)",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,What are URL Processors? How to internationalize Blueprint URLs?,"URL processors are a new feature in Flask 0.7. The notion is that you may have a collection of resources with similar components in the URL that you don't always want to supply explicitly. For example, you might have a bunch of URLs with language code in them, but you don't want to have to deal with it in each and every function.

When used in conjunction with blueprints, URL processors are extremely useful. We'll deal with both application-specific URL processors and blueprint specifics here.

Internationalized Blueprint URLs: It's simple to prefix all URLs with a common string using blueprints, and it's trivial to do so for every function. Furthermore, blueprints can contain per-blueprint URL processors, which takes a lot of complexity from the url_defaults() function by eliminating the need to check if the URL is truly interested in the 'lang_code' parameter:

from flask import Blueprint, g[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]bp = Blueprint('frontend', __name__, url_prefix='/<lang_code>')[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]@bp.url_defaults[Text Wrapping Break]def add_language_code(endpoint, values):[Text Wrapping Break]    values.setdefault('lang_code', g.lang_code)[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]@bp.url_value_preprocessor[Text Wrapping Break]def pull_lang_code(endpoint, values):[Text Wrapping Break]    g.lang_code = values.pop('lang_code')[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]@bp.route('/')[Text Wrapping Break]def index():[Text Wrapping Break]    ...[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]@bp.route('/about')[Text Wrapping Break]def about():[Text Wrapping Break]    ...",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,Explain async and await in the Flask application. When do we use Quart instead?,"If Flask is installed with the async extra, routes, error handlers, before request, after request, and teardown methods can all be coroutine functions (pip install flask[async]). Where ContextVars are used, Python 3.7 or above is required. ContextVar is a variable that can be used. Async def and await can now be used to define views.

@app.route(""/get-data"")[Text Wrapping Break]async def get_data():[Text Wrapping Break]    data = await async_db_query(...)[Text Wrapping Break]    return jsonify(data)

Coroutine-based handlers are also supported by pluggable class-based views. This is true for views that inherit from the flask.views' dispatch_request() method. All HTTP method handlers in views that inherit from flask.views, as well as the View class. MethodView is a class that represents a method.

The execution of async functions necessitates the use of an event loop. As a WSGI application, Flask employs a single worker to manage a single request/response cycle. When an async view receives a request, Flask creates an event loop in a thread, runs the view function there, and then returns the result.

Even for async views, each request ties up one worker. On the plus side, you may use async code within a view to perform numerous concurrent database queries, HTTP connections to an external API, and so on. However, the maximum number of requests your application can manage at any given time will not change.

Async code isn't always faster than sync code. When doing concurrent IO-bound work, async is useful, but it is unlikely to improve CPU-bound operations. Traditional Flask views will continue to be appropriate for the majority of use cases, but Flask's async support allows you to write and use code that wasn't previously possible.

When to use Quart instead: Because of the way Flask's async support is designed, it is slower than async-first frameworks. It makes sense to investigate Quart if your codebase is primarily async. Quart is a Flask reimplementation based on the ASGI standard rather than the WSGI standard. This enables it to manage a large number of concurrent requests, long-running requests, and WebSockets without the need for many worker processes or threads.

Many of the benefits of async request handling can also be obtained by running Flask with Gevent or Eventlet. To do this, these libraries tweak low-level Python methods, whereas async/ await and ASGI make use of regular, current Python features. Understanding the individual needs is the most important factor in deciding whether to utilize Flask, Quart or something else.",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,Deploy Flask application with Setuptools.,"Setuptools is a Python extension library for distributing Python libraries and extensions. It enhances distutils, a rudimentary module installation system included with Python, to include a number of more complicated operations that make it easier to distribute larger applications:

    Support for dependencies: a library or application can specify a list of additional libraries it relies on, which will be installed for you automatically.
    Setuptools registers your package with your Python installation through the package registry. This allows you to query information from one package using information from another package. The entry point support, which allows one package to define a ""entry point"" that another package can hook into to expand the other package, is the most well-known feature of this system.
    Installation manager: Other libraries can be installed using pip.

Setuptools or distutils are used to distribute Flask and all of the libraries available on PyPI. If you have already installed Flask, then you also have setuptools available on your system because Flask is dependable on setuptools. A Flask application's basic setup.py file looks like this:

from setuptools import setup[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]setup([Text Wrapping Break]    name='Your Application',[Text Wrapping Break]    version='1.0',[Text Wrapping Break]    long_description=__doc__,[Text Wrapping Break]    packages=['yourapplication'],[Text Wrapping Break]    include_package_data=True,[Text Wrapping Break]    zip_safe=False,[Text Wrapping Break]    install_requires=['Flask'][Text Wrapping Break])

Please keep in mind that you must explicitly list subpackages. You can use the find packages method to have setuptools hunt up the packages for you automatically:

from setuptools import setup, find_packages[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]setup([Text Wrapping Break]    ...[Text Wrapping Break]    packages=find_packages()[Text Wrapping Break])",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,Deploy Flask application with Fabric.,"Fabric is a Python program that works similarly to Makefiles but also allows you to run commands on a remote server. Flask applications may be easily deployed to other servers when used in conjunction with a well configured Python package (Large Applications as Packages) and a good configuration concept (Configuration Handling).

Before we get started, here's a quick rundown of what we need to be sure of:

    Fabric 1.0 must be installed on a local computer. This tutorial assumes you have the most recent version of Fabric installed.
    The program must already be packaged and must have a working setup.py file (Deploying with Setuptools).

Create a simple Fabfile: Fabric's execution is controlled by a fabfile. It's called fabfile.py, and it's run with the fab program. All of the functions in that file will be available as fab subcommands. They are run on a single or several hosts. These hosts can be specified on the command line or in the fabfile. We'll add them to the fabfile in this scenario.

This is a simple initial example that allows you to upload current source code to the server and install it into a virtual environment that already exists:

from fabric.api import *[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]# the user to use for the remote commands[Text Wrapping Break]env.user = 'appuser'[Text Wrapping Break]# the servers where the commands are executed[Text Wrapping Break]env.hosts = ['server1.example.com', 'server2.example.com'][Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]def pack():[Text Wrapping Break]    # build the package[Text Wrapping Break]    local('python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar', capture=False)[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]def deploy():[Text Wrapping Break]    # figure out the package name and version[Text Wrapping Break]    dist = local('python setup.py --fullname', capture=True).strip()[Text Wrapping Break]    filename = f'{dist}.tar.gz'[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]    # upload the package to the temporary folder on the server[Text Wrapping Break]    put(f'dist/{filename}', f'/tmp/{filename}')[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]    # install the package in the application's virtualenv with pip[Text Wrapping Break]    run(f'/var/www/yourapplication/env/bin/pip install /tmp/{filename}')[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]    # remove the uploaded package[Text Wrapping Break]    run(f'rm -r /tmp/{filename}')[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]    # touch the .wsgi file to trigger a reload in mod_wsgi[Text Wrapping Break]    run('touch /var/www/yourapplication.wsgi')

So, how do you put that fabfile into action? The fab command is what you use. This command would be used to deploy the current version of the code to the remote server:

$ fab pack deploy",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,How to redirect a user to another endpoint? Explain how to handle errors for redirecting a user.,"Use the redirect() function to send a user to another endpoint; use the abort() function to abort a request early with an error code:

from flask import abort, redirect, url_for[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]@app.route('/')[Text Wrapping Break]def index():[Text Wrapping Break]    return redirect(url_for('login'))[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]@app.route('/login')[Text Wrapping Break]def login():[Text Wrapping Break]    abort(401)[Text Wrapping Break]    this_is_never_executed()

Because a user will be diverted from the index to a page they cannot access (401 denotes access forbidden), this is a fairly worthless example, but it demonstrates how it works.

For each error code, a black and white error page is displayed by default. You may use the errorhandler() decorator to personalize the error page:

from flask import render_template[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]@app.errorhandler(404)[Text Wrapping Break]def page_not_found(error):[Text Wrapping Break]    return render_template('page_not_found.html'), 404

Take note of the 404 that appears following the render template() function. This tells Flask that the page's status code should be 404, which stands for ""not found."" By default, the value 200 is assumed, which means that everything went smoothly.",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,Describe Blueprint Error Handlers.,"Most error handlers will operate as expected in Modular Applications with Blueprints. There is a caveat, though, when it comes to handlers for 404 and 405 errors. These error handlers are only called when there is an appropriate raise statement or a call to abort in one of the blueprint's view functions; they are not called when there is invalid URL access, for example.

Because the blueprint does not own a certain URL space, the application instance has no means of knowing which blueprint error handler to apply if the URL is wrong. If you want to use alternative handling strategies for these errors based on URL prefixes, you can do so using the request proxy object at the application level.

from flask import jsonify, render_template[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]# at the application level[Text Wrapping Break]# not the blueprint level[Text Wrapping Break]@app.errorhandler(404)[Text Wrapping Break]def page_not_found(e):[Text Wrapping Break]    # if a request is in our blog URL space[Text Wrapping Break]    if request.path.startswith('/blog/'):[Text Wrapping Break]        # we return a custom blog 404 page[Text Wrapping Break]        return render_template(""blog/404.html""), 404[Text Wrapping Break]    else:[Text Wrapping Break]        # otherwise we return our generic site-wide 404 page[Text Wrapping Break]        return render_template(""404.html""), 404[Text Wrapping Break][Text Wrapping Break]@app.errorhandler(405)[Text Wrapping Break]def method_not_allowed(e):[Text Wrapping Break]    # if a request has the wrong method to our API[Text Wrapping Break]    if request.path.startswith('/api/'):[Text Wrapping Break]        # we return a json saying so[Text Wrapping Break]        return jsonify(message=""Method Not Allowed""), 405[Text Wrapping Break]    else:[Text Wrapping Break]        # otherwise we return a generic site-wide 405 page[Text Wrapping Break]        return render_templa",,,,,
https://www.knowledgehut.com/interview-questions/flask,What will you do if your codebase is growing so rapidly? How do you scale your application?,"Flask began as a demonstration of how to create your own framework using well-known tools like Werkzeug (WSGI) and Jinja (templating), but as it grew in popularity, it became helpful to a broader audience. Don't just utilize Flask as you expand your codebase; learn it. Check out the source. Flask's code is written to be read, and its documentation is available for users with its internal APIs. Flask follows upstream libraries' defined APIs and describes its internal utilities so you can locate the hook points you need for your project.

Hook and Extend: The API documentation is full of overrides, hook points, and Signals. Custom classes can be provided for request and response objects, for example. Look at the APIs you're using and see what customizations are available right out of the box in a Flask release. Look for ways to rework your project into a collection of Flask extensions and utilities. If you can't discover what you're looking for among the many Extensions in the community, seek for patterns to develop your own.

Subclass: Many methods of the Flask class are intended for subclassing. Subclassing Flask (see the linked method instructions) and using that subclass anywhere you instantiate an application class allows you to rapidly add or alter behavior. This is a great way to use Application Factories. For an example, see Flask Subclassing.

Wrap with middleware: The Application Dispatching pattern explains how to use middleware in detail. To encapsulate your Flask instances and introduce repairs and updates at the layer between your Flask application and your HTTP server, you can use WSGI middleware. Werkzeug comes with a number of middlewares.

Fork: Fork Flask if none of the preceding options work. Werkzeug and Jinja2 contain the majority of Flask's code. The majority of the work is done by these libraries. Flask is simply the glue that holds them together. Every project has a moment where the underlying framework becomes a hindrance (due to assumptions the original developers had). This is understandable because if it weren't, the framework would be an extremely complex system from the start, resulting in a steep learning curve and a lot of user irritation.

For many online applications, code complexity is less of a concern than scaling for the expected number of users or data entries. Flask's scalability capabilities are restricted solely by your application code, the data store you choose to utilize, and the Python implementation and web server you're using.

Scaling well means, for example, that doubling the number of servers yields roughly double the performance. Scaling poorly means that adding a new server will not improve performance or will not even support a second server. In Flask, the context local proxies are the only limiting element in terms of scaling. They are dependent on context, which is defined in Flask as a thread, process, or greenlet. Flask will no longer be able to support global proxies if your server uses a concurrency model that isn't based on threads or greenlets. However, the majority of servers achieve concurrency by using threads, greenlets, or different processes, all of which are fully supported by the Werkzeug framework.",,,,,

https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.1. What are the key features of Python?,"If it makes for an introductory language to programming, Python must mean something. These are its qualities:
 
 Interpreted
 Dynamically-typed
 Object-oriented
 Concise and simple
 Free
 Has a large community",,,,,
https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.2. Differentiate between lists and tuples.,"The major difference is that a list is mutable, but a tuple is immutable. Examples:
 
 >>> mylist=[1,3,3]

https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.3. Explain the ternary operator in Python.,"Unlike C++, we don’t have ?: in Python, but we have this:
 
 [on true] if [expression] else [on false]
 
 If the expression is True, the statement under [on true] is executed. Else, that under [on false] is executed.
 
 Below is how you would use it:
 
 >>> a,b=2,3
 >>> min=a if a<b else b
 >>> min
 2
 
 >>> print(""Hi"") if a<b else print(""Bye"")
 Hi",,,,,
https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.4. What are negative indices?,"Let’s take a list for this.
 
 >>> mylist=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
 A negative index, unlike a positive one, begins searching from the right.
 
 >>> mylist[-3]
 6
 
 This also helps with slicing from the back:
 
 >>> mylist[-6:-1]
 [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]",,,,,
https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.5. Is Python case-sensitive?,"A language is case-sensitive if it distinguishes between identifiers like myname and Myname. In other words, it cares about case- lowercase or uppercase. Let’s try this with Python.
 
 
 >>> myname='Ayushi'
 >>> Myname
 Traceback (most recent call last):
 
 File ""<pyshell#3>"", line 1, in <module>
 
 Myname
 
 NameError: name ‘Myname’ is not defined
 
 As you can see, this raised a NameError. This means that Python is indeed case-sensitive.",,,,,
https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.6. How long can an identifier be in Python?,"According to the official Python documentation, an identifier can be of any length. However, PEP 8 suggests that you should limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. Also, PEP 20 says ‘readability counts’. So, a very long identifier will violate PEP-8 and PEP-20.
 
 Apart from that, there are certain rules we must follow to name one:
 
 It can only begin with an underscore or a character from A-Z or a-z.
 The rest of it can contain anything from the following: A-Z/a-z/_/0-9.
 Python is case-sensitive, as we discussed in the previous question.
 Keywords cannot be used as identifiers. Python has the following keywords:
 and def False import not True
 as del finally in or try
 assert elif for is pass while
 break else from lambda print with
 class except global None raise yield
 continue exec if nonlocal return

https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.7. How would you convert a string into lowercase?,"We use the lower() method for this.
 
 >>> 'AyuShi'.lower()
 ‘ayushi’
 
 To convert it into uppercase, then, we use upper().
 
 >>> 'AyuShi'.upper()
 ‘AYUSHI’
 
 Also, to check if a string is in all uppercase or all lowercase, we use the methods isupper() and islower().
 
 >>> 'AyuShi'.isupper()
 False
 
 >>> 'AYUSHI'.isupper()
 True
 
 >>> 'ayushi'.islower()
 True
 
 >>> '@yu$hi'.islower()
 True
 
 >>> '@YU$HI'.isupper()
 True
 
 So, characters like @ and $ will suffice for both cases
 
 Also, istitle() will tell us if a string is in title case.
 
 >>> 'The Corpse Bride'.istitle()
 True",,,,,
https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.8. What is the pass statement in Python?,"There may be times in our code when we haven’t decided what to do yet, but we must type something for it to be syntactically correct. In such a case, we use the pass statement.
 
 >>> def func(*args):
 pass
 >>>
 
 Similarly, the break statement breaks out of a loop.
 
 >>> for i in range(7):
 if i==3: break
 print(i)

But to be truly accepting of a great technology, you must know its pitfalls as well. Would you like to talk about this?","Of course. To be truly yourself, you must be accepting of your flaws. Only then can you move forward to work on them. Python has its flaws too:
 
 Python Interview Question - limitations of Python
 
 Python’s interpreted nature imposes a speed penalty on it.
 While Python is great for a lot of things, it is weak in mobile computing, and in browsers.
 Being dynamically-typed, Python uses duck-typing (If it looks like a duck, it must be a duck). This can raise runtime errors.
 Python has underdeveloped database access layers. This renders it a less-than-perfect choice for huge database applications.
 And then, well, of course. Being easy makes it addictive. Once a Python-coder, always a Python coder.",,,,,
https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,"Q.16. With Python, how do you find out which directory you are currently in?","To find this, we use the function/method getcwd(). We import it from the module os.

 To create a thread, we create a class that we make override the run method of the thread class. Then, we instantiate it.
 A thread that we just created is in the new state. When we make a call to start() on it, it forwards the threads for scheduling. These are in the ready state.
 When execution begins, the thread is in the running state.
 Calls to methods like sleep() and join() make a thread wait. Such a thread is in the waiting/blocked state.
 When a thread is done waiting or executing, other waiting threads are sent for scheduling.
 A running thread that is done executing terminates and is in the dead state.

https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.39. What data types does Python support?,"Python provides us with five kinds of data types:
 
 Numbers – Numbers use to hold numerical values.
 
 >>> a=7.0
 >>>
 Strings – A string is a sequence of characters. We declare it using single or double quotes.
 
 >>> title=""Ayushi's Book""
 Lists – A list is an ordered collection of values, and we declare it using square brackets.
 
 >>> colors=['red','green','blue']
 >>> type(colors)
 <class ‘list’>
 
 Tuples – A tuple, like a list, is an ordered collection of values. The difference. However, is that a tuple is immutable. This means that we cannot change a value in it.

https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.42. How do you take input in Python?,"For taking input from the user, we have the function input(). In Python 2, we had another function raw_input().
 
 The input() function takes, as an argument, the text to be displayed for the task:
 
 >>> a=input('Enter a number')
 Enter a number7
 
 But if you have paid attention, you know that it takes input in the form of a string.
 
 
 >>> type(a)
 <class ‘str’>
 
 Multiplying this by 2 gives us this:
 
 >>> a*=2
 >>> a
 ’77’

 Top Python Interview Questions and Answers",,,,,
https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.57. How would you work with numbers other than those in the decimal number system?,"With Python, it is possible to type numbers in binary, octal, and hexadecimal.
 
 Binary numbers are made of 0 and 1. To type in binary, we use the prefix 0b or 0B.
 
 >>> int(0b1010)
 10
 
 To convert a number into its binary form, we use bin().
 
 >>> bin(0xf)
 ‘0b1111’
 
 
 Octal numbers may have digits from 0 to 7. We use the prefix 0o or 0O.
 
 >>> oct(8)
 ‘0o10’
 
 Hexadecimal numbers may have digits from 0 to 15. We use the prefix 0x or 0X.
 
 >>> hex(16)
 ‘0x10’
 
 >>> hex(15)
 ‘0xf’
 
 DataFlair’s latest article on Python Numbers with Examples",,,,,
https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.58. What does the following code output?,">>> def extendList(val, list=[]):
 list.append(val)
 return list
 >>> list1 = extendList(10)
 >>> list2 = extendList(123,[])
 >>> list3 = extendList('a')
 >>> list1,list2,list3
 ([10, ‘a’], [123], [10, ‘a’])
 
 You’d expect the output to be something like this:
 
 ([10],[123],[‘a’])
 
 Well, this is because the list argument does not initialize to its default value ([]) every time we make a call to the function. Once we define the function, it creates a new list. Then, whenever we call it again without a list argument, it uses the same list. This is because it calculates the expressions in the default arguments when we define the function, not when we call it.",,,,,
https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.59. How many arguments can the range() function take?,"The range() function in Python can take up to 3 arguments. Let’s see this one by one.
 
 a. One argument
 
 When we pass only one argument, it takes it as the stop value. Here, the start value is 0, and the step value is +1.
 
 >>> list(range(5))
 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
 
 >>> list(range(-5))
 []
 
 >>> list(range(0))
 []
 
 b. Two arguments
 
 When we pass two arguments, the first one is the start value, and the second is the stop value.

https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.66. Explain Python’s parameter-passing mechanism.,"To pass its parameters to a function, Python uses pass-by-reference. If you change a parameter within a function, the change reflects in the calling function. This is its default behavior. However, when we pass literal arguments like strings, numbers, or tuples, they pass by value. This is because they are immutable.",,,,,
https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.67. What is the with statement in Python?,"The with statement in Python ensures that cleanup code is executed when working with unmanaged resources by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks. It may be used to open a file, do something, and then automatically close the file at the end. It may be used to open a database connection, do some processing, then automatically close the connection to ensure resources are closed and available for others. with will cleanup the resources even if an exception is thrown. This statement is like the using statement in C#.
 Consider you put some code in a try block, then in the finally block, you close any resources used. The with statement is like syntactic sugar for that.
 
 The syntax of this control-flow structure is:
 
 with expression [as variable]:
 ….with-block

 #processing statements",,,,,
https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.68. How is a .pyc file different from a .py file?,"While both files hold bytecode, .pyc is the compiled version of a Python file. It has platform-independent bytecode. Hence, we can execute it on any platform that supports the .pyc format. Python automatically generates it to improve performance(in terms of load time, not speed).
 
 Python OOPS Interview Questions and Answers",,,,,
https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.69. What makes Python object-oriented?,"Again the frequently asked Python Interview Question
 
 Python is object-oriented because it follows the Object-Oriented programming paradigm. This is a paradigm that revolves around classes and their instances (objects). With this kind of programming, we have the following features:
 
 Encapsulation
 Abstraction
 Inheritance
 Polymorphism
 Data hiding",,,,,
https://data-flair.training/blogs/top-python-interview-questions-answer/,Q.70. How many types of objects does Python support?,"Objects in Python are mutable and immutable. Let’s talk about these.
 
 Immutable objects- Those which do not let us modify their contents. Examples of these will be tuples, booleans, strings, integers, floats, and complexes. Iterations on such objects are faster.
 
 >>> tuple=(1,2,4)
 >>> tuple
 (1, 2, 4)
 
 >>> 2+4j
 (2+4j)
 
 Mutable objects – Those that let you modify their contents. Examples of these are lists, sets, and dicts. Iterations on such objects are slower.
 
 >>> [2,4,9]
 [2, 4, 9]
 
 >>> dict1={1:1,2:2}
 >>> dict1
 {1: 1, 2: 2}
 
 While two equal immutable objects’ reference variables share the same address, it is possible to create two mutable objects with the same content.

 what is the difference between the IDE and IDLE in python?
 
 Reply
 DataFlair Team March 22, 2021 at 3:59 pm
 IDE is a acronym which stands for Integrated Development Environment. This is a software environment which usually consist of a software development package containing Code Editor, Build Automation, Tools and Debugger.
 
 IDLE is a acronym for Integrated Development and Learning Environment. This includes the basic packages and concepts of an IDE in addition for learning and educational purposes .
 
 For Python this is intended to be a simple IDE suited for beginners… especially those in an education environment.

 Relacyjna baza danych to rodzaj bazy danych, który pozwala przechowywać powiązane ze sobą elementy danych i zapewnia do nich dostęp. Relacyjne bazy danych są oparte na modelu relacyjnym — jest to prosty i intuicyjny sposób przedstawiania danych w tabelach. W relacyjnej bazie danych każdy wiersz tabeli jest rekordem z unikatowym identyfikatorem nazywanym kluczem. Kolumny tabeli zawierają atrybuty danych, a każdy rekord zawiera zwykle wartość dla każdego atrybutu, co ułatwia ustalenie relacji między poszczególnymi elementami rekordu.
 Prosty, ale silny model relacyjny jest używany przez różnego rodzaju i różnej wielkości przedsiębiorstwa do zaspokajania szerokiej gamy potrzeb informacyjnych. Relacyjne bazy danych służą do śledzenia zapasów, przetwarzania transakcji w handlu elektronicznym, zarządzania ogromnymi ilościami kluczowych informacji o klientach itd. Relacyjna baza danych może służyć do zaspokajania dowolnych potrzeb informacyjnych w sytuacjach, w których elementy danych są ze sobą powiązane i muszą być zarządzane w sposób bezpieczny, oparty na regułach i spójny.
 Relacyjne bazy danych istnieją od lat 70-tych XX wieku. Zalety modelu relacyjnego sprawiają, że jest to nadal najszerzej akceptowany model baz danych.
 Rodzaje relacji:
 Jeden do jednego jeden rekord może mieć swój odpowiednik w drugiej bazie
 Wiele do jednego jeden rekord może mieć wiele swoich odpowiedników w drugiej bazie danych
 Wiele do wielu rekordy mogą wzjamnie uzupełniać aby utworzyć takie połącznie należy utworzyć tabelę uzupełnień
 Bazy danych NoSQL (ang. non SQL, non relational, Not Only SQL) – bazy danych, w których można przechowywać, organizować i wyszukiwać dane w inny sposób niż w tabelach relacyjnych znanych z tradycyjnych RDBMS.
  
 NoSQL jest przydatny w przypadku danych o dużym wolumenie, które będzie można stosunkowo łatwo skalować horyzontalnie – w klastrach i na wielu serwerach – mowa między innymi o Big Data.",,,,,

 Example of enumerate() is as follows:
 
 Suppose we want to do numbering for our month ( Jan, Feb, Marc, ….June), so we declare the variable i that enumerate the numbers while m will print the number of month in list.
 
 #use a for loop over a collection
 Months = [""Jan"",""Feb"",""Mar"",""April"",""May"",""June""]
 for i, m in enumerate (Months):
  print(i,m)

It is used to store collections of data. In Python programming, arrays are handled by the “array” module. If you create arrays using the array module, elements of the array must be of the same numeric type.
 
 Example:
 
 import array as myarray
 abc = myarray.array('d', [2.5, 4.9, 6.7])",,,,,
https://www.guru99.com/python-interview-questions-answers.html,63) How can you access array elements?,"You can access any array item by using its index.
 
 The syntax is
 
 arrayName[indexNum] 
 Example:
 
 import array
 balance = array.array('i', [300,200,100])
 print(balance[1])",,,,,
https://www.guru99.com/python-interview-questions-answers.html,64) How can you insert elements in array?,"Python array insert operation enables you to insert one or more items into an array at the beginning, end, or any given index of the array. This method expects two arguments index and value.
 
 The syntax is
 
 arrayName.insert(index, value) 
 Example:
 
 Let us add a new value right after the second item of the array. Currently, our balance array has three items: 300, 200, and 100. Consider the second array item with a value of 200 and index 1.
 
 In order to insert the new value right “after” index 1, you need to reference index 2 in your insert method, as shown in the below Python array example:
 
 import array
 balance = array.array('i', [300,200,100])
 balance.insert(2, 150)
 print(balance)",,,,,
https://www.guru99.com/python-interview-questions-answers.html,65) How can you delete elements in array?,"With this operation, you can delete one item from an array by value. This method accepts only one argument, value. After running this method, the array items are re-arranged, and indices are re-assigned.
 
 The syntax is
 
 arrayName.remove(value)
 Example:
 
 Let’s remove the value of “3” from the array
 
 import array as myarray
 first = myarray.array('b', [2, 3, 4]) 
 first.remove(3) 
 print(first)",,,,,

 The syntax is
 
 arrayName.index(value) 
 Example:
 
 Let’s find the value of “3” in the array. This method returns the index of the searched value.
 
 import array as myarray
 number = myarray.array('b', [2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

 in Membership-returns true if a letter exists in the given string u is present in word Guru, and hence it will give 1 (True)
 not in Membership-returns true if a letter exists is not in the given string l not present in word Guru and hence it will give 1
 r/R Raw string suppresses the actual meaning of escape characters. Print r’\n’ prints \n and print R’/n’ prints \n
 % – Used for string format %r – It insert the canonical string representation of the object (i.e., repr(o)) %s- It inserts the presentation string representation of the object (i.e., str(o)) %d- it will format a number for display The output of this code will be “guru 99”.

https://hackr.io/blog/python-interview-questions,Question: Describe how multithreading is achieved in Python.,"Answer: Even though Python comes with a multi-threading package, if the motive behind multithreading is to speed the code then using the package is not the go-to option.
 The package has something called the GIL or Global Interpreter Lock, which is a construct. It ensures that one and only one of the threads execute at any given time. A thread acquires the GIL and then do some work before passing it to the next thread.
 This happens so fast that to a user it seems that threads are executing in parallel. Obviously, this is not the case as they are just taking turns while using the same CPU core. Moreover, GIL passing adds to the overall overhead to the execution.
 Hence, if you intend to use the threading package for speeding up the execution, using the package is not recommended.",,,,,
https://hackr.io/blog/python-interview-questions,Question: Draw a comparison between the range and xrange in Python.,"Answer: In terms of functionality, both range and xrange are identical. Both allow for generating a list of integers. The main difference between the two is that while range returns a Python list object, xrange returns an xrange object.
 Xrange is not able to generate a static list at runtime the way range does. On the contrary, it creates values along with the requirements via a special technique called yielding. It is used with a type of object known as generators.
 If you have a very enormous range for which you need to generate a list, then xrange is the function to opt for. This is especially relevant for scenarios dealing with a memory-sensitive system, such as a smartphone.
 The range is a memory beast. Using it requires much more memory, especially if the requirement is gigantic. Hence, in creating an array of integers to suit the needs, it can result in a Memory Error and ultimately lead to crashing the program.",,,,,

 SQLite stores data as a single file in the filesystem. Now, you need to tell Django how to use the database. For this, the project�s setting.py file needs to be used. Following code must be added to the file for making the database workable with the Django project:
 If you need to use a database server other than the SQLite, such as MS SQL, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, then you need to use the database�s administration tools to create a brand new database for your Django project.
 You have to modify the following keys in the DATABASE �default� item to make the new database work with the Django project:
 NOTE: - Settings like Host, Password, and User needs to be added when not choosing SQLite as the database.
 Check out the advantages and disadvantages of Django.

https://hackr.io/blog/python-interview-questions,Question: How will you differentiate between deep copy and shallow copy?,"Answer: We use a shallow copy when a new instance type gets created. It keeps the values that are copied in the new instance. Just like it copies the values, the shallow copy also copies the reference pointers.
 Reference points copied in the shallow copy reference to the original objects. Any changes made in any member of the class affect the original copy of the same. Shallow copy enables faster execution of the program.
 Deep copy is used for storing values that are already copied. Unlike shallow copy, it doesn�t copy the reference pointers to the objects. Deep copy makes the reference to an object in addition to storing the new object that is pointed by some other object.
 Changes made to the original copy will not affect any other copy that makes use of the referenced or stored object. Contrary to the shallow copy, deep copy makes execution of a program slower. This is due to the fact that it makes some copies for each object that is called.",,,,,
https://hackr.io/blog/python-interview-questions,Question: How will you distinguish between NumPy and SciPy?,"Answer: Typically, NumPy contains nothing but the array data type and the most basic operations, such as basic element-wise functions, indexing, reshaping, and sorting. All the numerical code resides in SciPy.
 As one of NumPy�s most important goals is compatibility, the library tries to retain all features supported by either of its predecessors. Hence, NumPy contains a few linear algebra functions despite the fact that these more appropriately belong to the SciPy library.

 Covariance for variables that have large deviations from the mean would become large but the variables could still be related to each other. Correlation is thus a better metric than covariance for it divides out the standard deviations of the variables. 
 If we want to write a code in Python, and we are not sure whether it is error-free or not, then we can use try-except-finally in Python. 
 So far, most programming languages didn’t allow negative indexing and Python is one of those rare languages which supports that. Negative indexing means that one can use negative numbers to access the elements of an array. But, the key point to remember is that the index -1 represents the last element of the array, -2 represents the second last element of the array and so on. Thus, in negative indexing, the counting starts from where the array ends.
